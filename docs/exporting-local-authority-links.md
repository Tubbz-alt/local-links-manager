# Exporting Local Authority links to services

Exports are run daily and produce a `links_to_services_provided_by_local_authorities.csv`
file in the `public/data` directory. This is publicly available at
https://local-links-manager.publishing.service.gov.uk/links-export which
redirects to the static file at `/data/links_to_services_provided_by_local_authorities.csv`
at present.

A link to this file is published at https://data.gov.uk/dataset/local-authority-services.
They also host a cached, zipped version which is updated daily.

The file contains the following headers (we tried to keep these as similar to
the localdirect.gov.uk file as possible) :

| Header             | Description                                                               |
